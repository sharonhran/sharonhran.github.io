			<center><h1><i>The New Yorker</i>: June 24, 2013 Issue</h1></center>
			

			<p>As Michael Bierut pointed out The New Yorker&rsquo;s slow design a couple of years back, the June 24, 2013 cover does not make a huge leap in design, nothing too radical. However, the cover has both a controlled and engaging design. Simple shapes are arranged and cover the entire page, yet the different elements that create this piece are specifically developed and effectively communicate the strong presence of hierarchy in these elements. This piece as a whole contains many components that allow depth in the content.</p>
			
		<h2> The Design</h2>
		
			<p>The line work in the piece is crisp and clear.  The subjects and the environment act more as visual representation rather than realistically rendered.  Both flat areas and volumes are incorporated, but it does not bother me that the curtain is the only object showing form through the use of gradation.  No shapes and forms are intricate or complicated: break the image apart, and I see series of rectangles enhanced with color, curvature, and layers. There are compliments present in this piece that serves it visually well. While the upper left side has more depth with dark color against the light, the bottom right area is made of more flat shapes and thin strokes of lines.  With consideration of color, it is effective to use the red and blue on the man&rsquo;s hat for the sake of emphasizing the American symbol. I appreciate the lamp being placed in this piece because of its small size next to a large window and it also supports the area of pure black along with the bed frame for creating balance. However, I am not quite sure if whether the faint green is effective in its color because the intensity and saturation is so close to the grays. I enjoy the play in size of the huge man taking over the entire window with only a quarter of his face compared to the rest of the room&rsquo;s scale. The enlarged face captivates the viewers&rsquo; attention and becomes the prominent aspect of the piece.
			</p>

			<p>The expressions of both subjects bring out lot of the interest to this piece. The man closely resembles Uncle Sam, just simplified and rendered in a cubistic manner. His act of invading personal privacy looks very intentional according to how his eyes are darting back, sharply towards the lady. The fact that he is faced in the opposite direction indicates even more that he is looking at her in an accusatory way.</p> 
			<br>
			<div class="blockquote"><i>
				Uncle Sam reminds me of the eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg in The Great Gatsby and the Big Brother in 1984.</i>
			</div>
			</br>
			 <p>Both symbolize power and all-knowingness, which is what Uncle Sam appears to stand for in this illustration. Directing our eyes in the direction Uncle Sam is looking, the lady typing on her laptop with her right hand, holding onto her phone against her ear with her left hand, and chattering away, seems to not notice anything. Wide-eyed and mouth opened, she looks away from the window, preoccupied with multitasking and has no idea that someone is watching her from a window. Their expressions are important to note because they keep the two subjects from having direct relationship, which brings a sense of tension. This is disturbing to me because the illustration translates as the government, Uncle Sam, is invading privacy in which she has no knowledge of. </p>

			<p>This piece reminds me of the progress of inserting microchips into our wrists to identify ourselves. Although I am not fully aware of the exact development of this process, I know that it&rsquo;s a way for the government to track citizens down electronically.  Spying is such an ambiguous concept because it&rsquo;s always a challenge to draw the line between assisting and not being able to practice our rights. This illustration communicates that Uncle Sam is not hovering into the window for the sake of ‘protecting a citizen&rsquo;. 
			</p>

			<h2>Unlike the Others</h2>

			<p>The stylistic choice made to render Uncle Sam makes the piece look like propaganda, especially with the patriotic colors. There is a question of whether the style used to render the bed and the woman helping in identifying this piece as a present-day propaganda, and if it might be more effective by being more consistent with the style. Because this is the front cover of a magazine and is used to public announce information and ideas, boldness or colors and shapes and a more rigid style is necessary to quickly catch the passing pairs of eyes.
			</p>

			<p>It is also interesting to note that as a magazine cover, there are minimal usage of text, including just the price, name, and date. This simplicity sets apart from other informational magazines that consume the front cover with catch phrases. I appreciate that it gives a breather for the artwork to stand on its own without any supporting texts. Though the cover illustration does not necessarily correlate directly to an article or story, it was interesting to find text about ‘A secret history of privacy&rsquo;. I wonder, however, if the context of the image in relation to a piece of writing would clarify the purpose of placing this political-related illustration on the front page. This particular magazine, meant to portray various issues at hand, brings one of many common political standpoints and the tension of weighing the politics to citizenship. Simply but narratively, the artist communicated the topic well and unified the various elements to the piece effectively.
